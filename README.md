This repository is currently acting as a platform for homework display, but it is also evolving into a tutorial to what I have learned. I will continue to maintain this repository up until 2020/2/1.

## For Teacher

Please only view the directories named in **Chinese** when looking for my homework.

The other files are no longer valid homework submissions as they have been modified beyond the deadline.

## For Others

I hope this repository/tutorial will be able to help you. Since you're a user of `GitHub`, I'm confident that you are a coder, or even better, an engineer. So I will minimize comments and let the code talk for itself. But rest assured, I will maximize the instructions given so that you don't get stuck before actually coding.

How nice of me. :)
