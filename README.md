This repository is currently acting as a platform for homework display, but it is also constantly evolving into a self-teaching guide. I will continue to constantly maintain this repository up until 2020/2/1.

## For Teacher

Please only view the directories named in **Chinese**.

The other files are no longer valid homework submissions, as they have been modified beyond the deadline. You can view them if you wish.

## For Peers and Future Course Takers

I do not welcome you, but I don't care if you copy my code or not. My code is built upon phase based commits, and can be tracked to the very point where I started, unlike yours, if you copy my code.

I hope my guide can help you with environment building and teach you how to code, but I do not hope you turn into a fraud who knows the shortcut keys for copy and paste.
