# 0 Quick Overview

`Big Data` is data of enormous scales typically starting from PBs.

`Big Data` faces two challenges, how to store it and how to process it.

# 1 Details

## 1.1 Who

Who should care about `Big Data`?  Or who has `Big Data`?

### 1.1.1 Companies

Nearly every company with a database has to deal with `Big Data`. I am saying this with confidence, since I had an internship developing a **Laboratory Safety Management System** using `MongoDB` and `Redis`.

### 1.1.2 Individuals

For the people within these companies, it is mainly the up to **Software Engineers** to deal with `Big Data`. They can be roughly divided into the following categories:

- Infrastructure development
- Algorithm development
- Maintenance

## 1.2 What

What is `Big Data`?

The short version, `Big Data` is data of enormous volume.

The long version, `Big data` is a field that treats ways to analyze, systematically extract information from, or otherwise deal with data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software.

For a more detailed life experience, you can try to grasp what `Big Data` is via these examples:

- *Engineer perspective*. Imagine yourself as a software engineer working at Google, and your boss suddenly hands you a magical disk. He claims that the disk holds 1PB(1024TB) of data, and he wants you to develop a system that can search through all that data within a second. The world's fastest disk can read data at around 800MB/s. How do you feel?
- *Data Mining Perspective.* Imagine yourself as a data analyst sitting in a Wall Street office. Your colleague just earned a million in the [futures market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futuresmarket.asp). He/She did it by mining through PBs of NASA data and market data and found out a correlation between constellations and oil prices. The algorithm he/she used was implemented within five lines. How do you feel?
- *Legal Perspective.* Imagine yourself working in a Big Data company, and you just wrote a Python crawler script to crawl credit data from banks. The next day, you find yourself in jail, and nobody cares what you feel.

## 1.5 Why

Why do we have to deal with `Big Data`?

### 1.5.1 Companies

This is the demand of the market. Your clients require that data, no matter how enormous, can be processed within a reasonable time, might that be a second or a minute.

### 1.5.2 Individuals

Well, you've got to make a living, don't you?
