# 0 Quick Overview

`Big Data` is data of enormous scales typically starting from PBs.

`Big Data` faces two challenges, how to store it and how to process it.

# 1 Details

## 1.1 Who

Who should care about `Big Data`?  Or who has `Big Data`?

### 1.1.1 Companies

Nearly every company with a database has to deal with `Big Data`. I am saying this with confidence, since I had an internship developing a **Laboratory Safety Management System** using `MongoDB` .

### 1.1.2 Individuals

For the people within these companies, it is mainly the up to **Software Engineers** to deal with `Big Data`. They can be divided into the following categories:

- Infrastructure development
- Algorithm development
- Maintenance

## 1.2 What

What is `Big Data`?

The short version, `Big Data` is data of enormous volume.

The long version, `Big data` is a field that treats ways to analyze, systematically extract information from, or otherwise deal with data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software.

## 1.3 When

I don't really know, and I don't really care. Feel free to *Bing* it.

## 1.4 Where

I'm not really sure if there is a meaning to describing where `Big Data` is.

## 1.5 Why



Here are several ways to view Big Data:

- *Engineer perspective*. Imagine yourself as a software engineer working at Google, and your boss suddenly hands you a magical disk. He claims that the disk holds 1PB(1024TB) of data, and he wants you to develop a system that can search through all that data within a second. The world's fastest disk can read data at around 800MB/s. How do you feel?
- *Data Mining Perspective.* Imagine yourself as a data analyst sitting in a Wall Street office. Your colleague just earned a million in the [futures market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futuresmarket.asp). He/She did it by mining through PBs of NASA data and market data and found out a correlation between constellations and oil prices. The algorithm he/she used was implemented within five lines. How do you feel?
- *Legal Perspective.* Imagine yourself working in a Big Data company, and you just wrote a Python crawler script to crawl credit data from banks. The next day, you find yourself in jail, and nobody cares what you feel.

In a very straightforward sense, `Big Data` is data that is big. Now, most people would think that this is rhetorically obvious and somewhat insulting if they are trying to seek a clear definition, yet it is not wrong, and you really don't need to go through the trouble of reciting an 'official' one.

# For People With Even More Time

Here's your 'official' definition, whatever that means.

- **Big data** is a field that treats ways to analyze, systematically extract information from, or otherwise deal with data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software.
- **Big data** is a term that describes the **large** volume of **data** -- both structured and unstructured -- that inundates a business on a day-to-day basis.
- Extremely large data sets that may be analyzed computationally to reveal patterns, trends, and associations, especially relating to human behavior and interactions.
- Big Data are data sets with magnitudes so big, that it would be considered unbearable to to traverse on a single computer.

I encourage you to *Google* it or *Bing* it, depending on where you are.
