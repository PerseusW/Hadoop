# KMeans MapReduce Implementation

This is the intellectual work of **171860611, 王麦迪**.

## Overview

[Input Data](input): There are 1000 points with the structure of <double, double>. These points obey even distribution on [0, 100].

[Source Code](code/MapReduce): Data structures and the KMeans algorithm is implemented here.

[Scripts](sbin): These scripts make life a lot easier for a person who doesn't use an IDE.

[Compiled Jars](jar): JVM executable jars.

[Output](output): Files along with data visualization results.
